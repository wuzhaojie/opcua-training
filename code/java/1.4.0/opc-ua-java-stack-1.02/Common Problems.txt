Common Problems - OPC UA Java Stack
-----------------------------------

When running the sample server (ServerExample1) and sample clients (ClientExample1 and SampleClient) you 
might encounter problems which prevent a successful connection. We have documented below common causes 
for connectivity problems, which include: 

- EndpointUrl mismatch
- Java Security Policies



EndpointUrl Mismatch
---------------------
	Summary:    The EndpointUrl used by the Client must match the Server's EndpointUrl.
	Resolution: 1. Launch the sample Server (ServerExample1)
				2. Find the EndpointUrl in the output console (e.g. opc.tcp://MyHost:8666/UAExample)
				3. Modify the "Run Configuration" for the Client (ClientExample1 or SampleClient): 
					a. In Eclipse, open Run -> Run Configurations...
					b. Expand "Java Application" in the left-navigation and choose a Client project.
					c. Click the "Arguments" tab
					d. Paste the Server's EndpointUrl (copied in step #2).
					e. Click "Apply" and then "Run".
				4. The Client should now connect successfully to the UA Server.




Java Security Policies
----------------------
	Summary:	You see an error (in red) that says "Illegal key size".
	Resolution:	1. Your Java runtime probably needs to update the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files.
				   (JRE 6: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html)
				2. Extract the JCE download contents: local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar 
				3. Copy the 2 files to your Java security directory (backup your original files first): 
				   (JRE 6: C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\lib\security)
				4. Recompile and re-run your Java sample applications, Server and Client!
