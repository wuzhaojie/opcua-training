    test harness, unit tests and the code generator.
        
build/
    
    All release files generated by the "build.xml" are placed in to this
    folder. The folder is created and deleted by this script. It is not
    intended to be committed into the source control and thus is configured
    to be ignored by SVN. See (4. Creating a release ) to create a build.
    
legal/

    This folder contains LICENSE files of all dependency libraries. 
            
build.xml

    Ant script for creating a release of the stack.
    The main target is "clean-build".
    See (4. Creating a release) for instructions how to create a release.

         
3. Code Generator

This chapter contains instructions how to build the code generated java source 
files.

The main class to run is codegen/org.opcfoundation.ua.codegen.Main2.
The generator reads descriptions in codegen_data/ and writes the output
source files to src/org.opcfoundation.ua.core.

The input data is located in these folders:

codegen_data/data/ contains data type descriptions and constants from ModelDesigner.
codegen_data/templates/ contains Java source code templates.
codegen_data/overrides/ contains exceptions to templates.

Note: In eclipse, remember to refresh (F5) the source tree after code generation. 

4. Creating a release 

This chapter contains instructions how to create a release.

Run build.xml. The default target is "clean-build".

    To run the script from command line run "ant -f build.xml" 
    (See http://ant.apache.org/). 

    To run the script from Eclipse, right click on the build.xml file, and choose
    from context menu "Run As / Ant Build".

To change the version numbering of the release files, see "version" and "status" variable 
in build.xml. 

The script creates "build/" folder and places the following release files there:

    OPC UA Java Stack XXX Source Code and Samples [XXX].zip
    
        The source code for the stack and examples - the main distribution 
        via OPC Foundation. 
        
     OPC UA Java Stack XXX Redistributables [XXX].zip
    
        This file contains the dependency libraries of the stack
        library. 
        
    OPC UA Java Stack XXX Samples [XXX].zip
    
        This archive file contains the stack binary, the libraries and the
        source for examples 
    
    Opc.Ua.Stack-xxx.jar
    
        This file contains the OPC UA Java Stack -library.
    
    Opc.Ua.Stack-xxx-javadoc.jar
    
        This file contains the javadoc for the OPC UA Java Stack -library.

    Opc.Ua.Stack-xxx-src.zip
    
        This file contains the source code for the OPC UA Java Stack -library.
    
5. Test Harness

This chapter contains instructions how to run the test harness.

Test Harness requires a server and a client. Run these two main classes: 
 1. org.opcfoundation.ua.server.TestServer
 2. org.opcfoundation.ua.stacktest.client.TestClient
 
The harness executes test cases defined in TestCases.xml and outputs
the results into TestLog.xml and ClientTestLog.xml.
