/**
 * Asyncronous input stream of asynchronous socket.
 * There are two positions properties: Bytes received (to buffer) and bytes read.
 * <p>
 * Synchronous reads can be made with use of alarm, e.g.
 *     BufferMonitor a = is.createBufferMonitor(is.getPosition() + 1000, null);
 *     a.waitForState(AlarmState.FINAL_STATES);
 *     byte[] data = new byte[1000];
 *     is.read(data);
 *
 * <p>
 * Note there is a limit (40kb) how much data is buffered. To up the limit set an alarm.
 * Creating an alarm to position Long.MAX_VALUE removes any limits of the buffer.
